        "description": "A genius engineer, Sancaka, was obsessed to invent an anti-lightning serum. In a freak accident, Sancaka was struck by a lightning, only to find out that he was actually adopted by Kronz, the King of Kingdom of Lightning. Kronz gave Sancaka a magic necklace that could transform him into a superhuman being, Gundala. Gundala is also known for his intuition in solving complicated crime cases. In Bumilangit Cinematic Universe, Sancaka works as a security guard and part-time mechanic at a printing factory. Since he was a child, he has shown signs of brilliance in tinkering with electrical products, but is afraid of lightning and storms that seem to always target him. One day, Sancaka helps his neighbor, Wulan, against some thugs who harass her. The thugs retaliated by attacking him at night while he was working in the factory and attempted to kill him by throwing Sancaka from the factory roof. After Sancaka’s body fell to the ground, a bolt of lightning struck him and revived him, giving him superhuman strength.",
